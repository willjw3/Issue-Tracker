* You can filter my get request by also passing along any field and value in the query(ie. <code>/api/issues/{project}?open=false</code>). You can pass along as many fields/values as I want.

Returned will be 'successfully updated' or 'could not update '+_id. This should always update <i>updated_on</i>. If no fields are sent return 'no updated field sent'.
